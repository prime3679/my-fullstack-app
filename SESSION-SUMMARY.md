## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### API Endpoints Added/Fixed
- `/api/v1/menu/restaurant/{restaurantId}` - Fixed menu fetching
- `/api/v1/checkin` - Check-in functionality
- `/api/v1/payments/create-payment-intent` - Stripe payment initiation
- `/api/v1/staff/dashboard` - Staff dashboard stats
- `/api/v1/reservations` - Reservation management

### Environment Variables Configured
```bash
# Frontend (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api/v1"

# Backend (.env)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed
1. Pre-order page not loading menu items
2. 404 error on payment page (page didn't exist)
3. "Reservation already has a pre-order" error handling
4. 404 on calculate endpoint (implemented workaround)
5. Missing payment page implementation
6. Incorrect API endpoint patterns

## 🚀 User Journey Flow
The complete flow now works as follows:
1. **Discovery** → Browse restaurants
2. **Reservation** → Book a table with date/time/party size
3. **Pre-order** → Select menu items with modifiers
4. **Payment** → Pay via Stripe with tip selection
5. **Confirmation** → Receive confirmation with order details
6. **Check-in** → Scan QR code at restaurant
7. **Kitchen** → Order appears in kitchen dashboard
8. **Service** → Staff manages through reservations console
